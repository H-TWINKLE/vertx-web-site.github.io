Vert.x 4.5 comes a couple of new exciting features.

Here is an overview of the most important features and changes supported in Vert.x 4.5.

## Virtual threads

Java 21 has finally brought virtual threads to Java and you can use them right now in
Vert.x to write code that looks like it is synchronous.

You still write the traditional Vert.x code processing events, but you have the opportunity
to write synchronous code for complex workflows and use thread locals in such workflows.

A virtual thread verticle is capable of awaiting Vert.x futures and gets the result synchronously.

```java
Verticle verticle = new AbstractVerticle() {
  @Override
  public void start() {
    HttpClient client = vertx.createHttpClient();
    HttpClientRequest req = Future.await(client.request(
      HttpMethod.GET,
      8080,
      "localhost",
      "/"));
    HttpClientResponse resp = Future.await(req.send());
    int status = resp.statusCode();
    Buffer body = Future.await(resp.body());
  }
};

// Run the verticle a on virtual thread
vertx.deployVerticle(verticle, new DeploymentOptions().setThreadingModel(ThreadingModel.VIRTUAL_THREAD));
```

[Vert.x virtual threads](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#virtual_threads) can block on any Vert.x future using `await`:

```java
// create a test table
await(pool.query("create table test(id int primary key, name varchar(255))").execute());
// insert some test data
await(pool.query("insert into test values (1, 'Hello'), (2, 'World')").execute());
// query some data
RowSet<Row> rows = await(pool.query("select * from test").execute());
for (Row row : rows) {
  System.out.println("row = " + row.toJson());
}
```

## Dynamic SQL connection creation

By default, a connection pool always connects to the same host, in other words the database
config is _static_.

Sometimes database config needs to be dynamic, e.g. connecting to an array of databases
or the database config can change.

With [dynamic connection configuration](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-pg-client/java/#_dynamic_connection_configuration) you can easily implement this in Vert.x:

```java
Pool pool = PgBuilder.pool()
  .with(poolOptions)
  .connectingTo(() -> {
    Future<SqlConnectOptions> connectOptions = retrieveOptions();
    return connectOptions;
  })
  .using(vertx)
  .build();
```

Each time the pool needs to create a connection, the options supplier is called and the returned
options is used to create the connection.

## PG bouncer transaction pooling mode

Level 7 proxies can load balance queries on several connections to the actual database. When it happens, the client can
be confused by the lack of session affinity and unwanted errors can happen like _ERROR: unnamed prepared
statement does not exist (26000)_.

Vert.x SQL client now [supports](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-pg-client/java/#_using_a_level_7_proxy) Level 7 proxies
like [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org).

## TCP SSL options update

You can now [update TCP client/server SSL options](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#_updating_ssltls_configuration)
at runtime which is very useful for certificate rotation.

```java
Future<Boolean> fut = server.updateSSLOptions(
  new SSLOptions()
    .setKeyCertOptions(new JksOptions()
      .setPath("/path/to/your/server-keystore.jks")
      .setPassword("password-of-your-keystore")));
```

New connections will use the updated configuration.

## WebSocket client

We have captured the WebSocket client API from Vert.x HTTP client in a new [WebSocket client](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#_websockets_on_the_client.

```java
WebSocketClient wsClient = vertx.createWebSocketClient();

Future<WebSocket> f = wsClient.connect(connectOptions);
```

This purpose of this change is to let the `HttpClient` interface focus on HTTP interactions
and clean up the interface.

## Client builders

We start to introduce the builder pattern for advanced client creation in 4.5.

The builder pattern facilitates the configuration and creation of Vert.x clients when they
need to be configured beyond options.

### Creating an HTTP client

Most of the time you will create an HTTP client using the good old `createHttpClient` method.

```java
HttpClient client = vertx.createHttpClient(options);
```

Sometimes you want to configure the client with extra behavior like setting a connection
handler or a redirect handler: the [HTTP client builder](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#_advanced_http_client_creation)
provides these extra configuration capabilities.

```java
// Since Vert.x 4.5 the following code
HttpClient client = vertx.createHttpClient(options)
        .connectionHandler(connectionHandler)
        .redirectHandler(redirectHandler);

// Should be replaced by
HttpClient client = vertx.httpClientBuilder()
        .withOptions(options)
        .withConnectionHandler(connectionHandler)
        .withRedirectHandler(redirectHandler)
        .build();
```

This enforces the configuration of handlers at creation time and produces an immutable client
with its configuration and handlers.

The fact is Vert.x 5 will provide more configuration capabilities like a client side 
load balancer and address resolver.

### Creating an SQL connection pool

Vert.x SQL client pool creation uses per database static pool creation methods, e.g.
`PgPool#create`.

There are a couple of good reasons to get away from `PgPool` like interfaces:

- those interfaces extend `Pool` but they never add new methods
- configuring extra behaviour like `connectHandler` is not well suited

```java
// Since Vert.x 4.5 the following code
PgPool client = PgPool.pool(vertx, connectOptions, poolOptions);

// Should be replaced by
Pool client = Pool.create(vertx, connectOptions, poolOptions);
        
// Or by
Pool client = PgBuilder.pool()
  .with(poolOptions)
  .connectingTo(connectOptions)
  .using(vertx)
  .build()
```

The latter is well suited when extra behavior is needed like setting a `connectHandler`.

```java
Pool client = PgBuilder.pool()
  .with(poolOptions)
  .withConnectHandler(connectHandler)
  .connectingTo(connectOptions)
  .using(vertx)
  .build()
```

## Redis command tracing

The Redis client can [trace command execution](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-redis-client/java/#_tracing_commands) when Vert.x has tracing enabled.

The client reports a client span with the following details:

- operation name: Command
- tags:
    - db.user: the database username, if set
    - db.instance: the database number, if known (typically 0)
    - db.statement: the Redis command, without arguments (e.g. get or set)
    - db.type: redis

## Traffic shaping

TCP server (net/HTTP) can be configured with [traffic shaping](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#_throttling_inbound_and_outbound_bandwidth_of_tcp_connections) options to enable bandwidth limiting.
