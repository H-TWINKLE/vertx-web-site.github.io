Hi Vert.x community! Today, we are really excited to announce the [Visual Studio Code Vert.x Starter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=danielpetisme.vscode-vertx-starter) extension.

The extension is a community contribution made by [Daniel Petisme (@danielpetisme)](https://twitter.com/danielpetisme).

## Usage

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular code editor with a lot of additional extensions.

[Visual Studio Code Vert.x Starter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=danielpetisme.vscode-vertx-starter) extension allows you to:
- Create a Vert.x project
- Customize the creation (Vert.x version, language, build tool, `groupId`, `artifactId`, package name, JDK version)
- Search for dependencies

The extension can be configured to match your context (e.g. defining your default company `groupId`).

## How it works

Behind the scene, the extension relies on the Vert.x application generator API and demonstrate how easy it is to develop your own IDE plugin or custom tooling to generate Vert.x projects.
For further details about the [start.vertx.io](https://start.vertx.io) API, please refer to the [Vert.x Starter project on GitHub](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-starter).
