We are extremely pleased to announce that Eclipse Vert.x version 4.5.8 has been released.

Since the release of Vert.x 4.5.7, quite a few bugs have been reported. We would like to thank you all for reporting these issues.

In addition, a couple of important items are noteworthy

## Future expectation + HTTP response expectations

You can use a new feature for HTTP/Web client that facilitate HTTP interactions, this new feature supersedes the Web
client response predicates API with a new expectation based API that provides the same features for both HTTP and Web clients.

```java
client
  .get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri")
  .send()
  .expecting(HttpResponseExpectation.SC_OK.and(HttpResponseExpectation.JSON))
  .onSuccess(res -> {
    // ....
  });
```

This feature is actually built on top of a the new `Future#expecting` operator that synchronously check the response of a predicate like
operator called `Expectation`

```java
Future.succeededFuture("hello")
   .expecting(res -> true)
   .onSuccess(s -> System.out.printl("Expectation met"));

Future.succeededFuture("hello")
   .expecting(res -> false)
   .onFailure(s -> System.out.printl("Expectation not met"));
```

Expectation are pretty much like a predicate, yet they provide a meaningful error message the expectation is not met.

It has multiple usage like the new `HttpResponseExpectation` that provides reusable expectations for both HTTP and Web client, it 
can also facilitate testing, e.g. we have defined this expectation in vertx-core tests

```java
public static <T> Expectation<T> that(Consumer<? super T> consumer) {
  return value -> {
    consumer.accept(value);
    return true;
  };
}

@Test
public void someTest() {
  Future<Result> fut = getSomeFuture()
     .expecting(that(res -> assertNotNull(res)));
}
```

## Default Hazelcast version

The Hazelcast dependency is changed to 5.3 since Hazelcast 4 is not anymore supported and 4.2.8 has known vulnerabilities
(CVE-2023-45860, CVE-2023-45859, CVE-2023-33265, CVE-2023-33264).

This cluster manager remains tested with Hazelcast 4.2.8 and 5.3, so 4.2.8 remains supported, the Hazelcast version must
be explicitly set to 4.2.8 if needed until an upgrade can be achieved.

The [4.5.8 release notes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/4.5.8-Release-Notes) as well as
[deprecations and breaking changes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/4.5.8-Deprecations-and-breaking-changes)
can be found on the wiki.

You can bootstrap a Vert.x 4 project using [start.vertx.io](https://start.vertx.io).

The release artifacts have been deployed to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.vertx%20AND%20v:4.5.8) and
you can get the distribution on [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/vertx/vertx-stack-manager/4.5.8/).

The [Vert.x 4 eventbus JavaScript client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vertx/eventbus-bridge-client.js) is now available
in a single location and it now usable standalone or it can easily be integrated with any frontend build tool.

The Vert.x distribution is available from [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io) and our
[HomeBrew TAP](https://github.com/vertx-distrib/homebrew-tap).

Docker images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/vertx/).

That's it! Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/channels).
