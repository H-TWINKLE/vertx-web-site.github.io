We are extremely pleased to announce that Eclipse Vert.x version 5.0.2 has been released.

Since the release of Vert.x 5.0.1, quite a few bugs have been reported. We would like to thank you all for reporting these issues.

The [5.0.2 release notes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/5.0.2-Release-Notes) as well as
[deprecations and breaking changes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/5.0.2-Deprecations-and-breaking-changes)
 can be found on the wiki.

You can bootstrap a Vert.x 5 project using [start.vertx.io](https://start.vertx.io).

The release artifacts have been deployed to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.vertx%20AND%20v:5.0.2).

The [Vert.x eventbus JavaScript client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vertx/eventbus-bridge-client.js) is now available
in a single location and it now usable standalone or it can easily be integrated with any frontend build tool.

That's it! Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/channels).
