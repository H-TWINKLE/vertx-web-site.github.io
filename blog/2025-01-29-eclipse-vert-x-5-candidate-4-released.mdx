We are extremely pleased to announce the third candidate release of Eclipse Vert.x 5.

Vert.x 5 is the evolution of the Vert.x 4.x series that will bring key features to Vert.x.

This release aims to provide candidate builds of the up-coming Vert.x 5 for people that
want to try it and provide feedback.

You can read the [highlights](https://vertx.io/blog/whats-new-in-vert-x-5/) of this new major release.
Note that both the [Vert.x Maven Plugin](https://reactiverse.io/vertx-maven-plugin/) and the [Reactiverse Contextual logging](https://reactiverse.io/reactiverse-contextual-logging/) library have a new major version supporting Vert.x 5.

In addition, you can read the [migration guide](https://vertx.io/blog/from-vert-x-4-to-vert-x-5/) to Vert.x 5.

## What's next ?

Vert.x 5 is scheduled for the first quarter of 2025, until the release you can expect a few candidate releases.
