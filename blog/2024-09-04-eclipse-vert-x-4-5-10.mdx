We are extremely pleased to announce that Eclipse Vert.x version 4.5.10 has been released.

Since the release of Vert.x 4.5.9, quite a few bugs have been reported. We would like to thank you all for reporting these issues.

In addition, this release fixes [CVE-2024-8391](https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vertx-grpc/issues/113) in Vert.x gRPC server
and client (Maven GAV io.vertx:vertx-grpc-server and io.vertx:vertx-grpc-client). Note, this does not affect the gRPC stack
based on grpc-java known as [gRPC Netty](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-grpc-netty/java/) (Maven GAV io.vertx:vertx-grpc)

The [4.5.10 release notes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/4.5.10-Release-Notes) as well as
[deprecations and breaking changes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/4.5.9-Deprecations-and-breaking-changes)
can be found on the wiki.

You can bootstrap a Vert.x 4 project using [start.vertx.io](https://start.vertx.io).

The release artifacts have been deployed to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.vertx%20AND%20v:4.5.10) and
you can get the distribution on [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/vertx/vertx-stack-manager/4.5.10/).

The [Vert.x 4 eventbus JavaScript client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vertx/eventbus-bridge-client.js) is now available
in a single location and it now usable standalone or it can easily be integrated with any frontend build tool.

The Vert.x distribution is available from [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io) and our
[HomeBrew TAP](https://github.com/vertx-distrib/homebrew-tap).

That's it! Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/channels).
