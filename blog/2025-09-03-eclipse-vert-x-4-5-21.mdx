We are extremely pleased to announce that Eclipse Vert.x version 4.5.21 has been released.

Since the release of Vert.x 4.5.20, quite a few bugs have been reported. We would like to thank you all for reporting these issues.

In addition, [CVE-2025-58057](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-3p8m-j85q-pgmj) and [CVE-2025-58056](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-fghv-69vj-qj49)
have been disclosed. Vert.x upgrades to [Netty 4.1.126.Final](https://netty.io/news/2025/09/03/4-1-126-Final.html) which
fixes both of them.
The [4.5.21 release notes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/4.5.21-Release-Notes) can be found on the wiki.

You can bootstrap a Vert.x 4 project using [start.vertx.io](https://start.vertx.io).

The release artifacts have been deployed to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.vertx%20AND%20v:4.5.21).

The [Vert.x 4 eventbus JavaScript client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vertx/eventbus-bridge-client.js) is now available
in a single location and it now usable standalone or it can easily be integrated with any frontend build tool.

The Vert.x distribution is available from [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io) and our
[HomeBrew TAP](https://github.com/vertx-distrib/homebrew-tap).

Vert.x follows a 2 years policy after a major release, as consequence Vert.x remains supported until April 2027 and get
bug fixes, you should consider [upgrading](https://vertx.io/blog/from-vert-x-4-to-vert-x-5/) your application to Vert.x 5.

That's it! Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/channels).
