Vert.x 3.2.1 applications can quickly be deployed on [Microsoft Azure](http://portal.azure.com/). Deployment is independent of your build so it is all about configuration.

## About Azure

Azure by design does not support `multicast` on the network virtualization level, however all virtual machines defined
on the same group are deployed on the same network (by default), so `TCP-IP` discovery can be enabled and quickly setup
to form a cluster.

This how you would deploy your app:

1. create a `fat-jar` with your app
2. create a `cluster.xml` with tcp-ip discovery
3. run your app with: `cp folder_of_your_cluster_xml_file -cluster -cluster-host VM_PRIVATE_IP`
