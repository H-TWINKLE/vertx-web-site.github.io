<Alert warning>

The blog post is informational and a teaser of upcoming changes to `pinot-client` which is under active
    development and thus, the finally released versions may differ. Currently, the client is not available
    for download on Maven Central.

## Introduction

Eclipse Vert.x is a toolkit to build reactive applications on the Java virtual machine. It provides asynchronous and
non-blocking clients for different types of databases. Apache Pinot is a realtime distributed datastore for analytics
workloads. The [Apache Pinot Java Client](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/users/clients/java) uses
[AsyncHttpClient](https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client) as the default transport. The `Apache Pinot Java Client`
is unpractical to use in Eclipse Vert.x applications because every blocking call needs to be wrapped with `executeBlocking`.

The [`pinot-client`](https://github.com/reactiverse/pinot-client) Reactiverse project is a lightweight wrapper around the existing Pinot Java client. It also provides an alternative transport using `vertx-web-client`.
This will make the Apache Pinot more accessible to Vert.x users.

## Advantages

1. `vertx-pinot-client` offers an async and non-blocking API, that is line with the general Vert.x ecosystem's philosophy.
2. For little effort we get `RxJava` and `Mutiny` bindings for the client as well, thanks to Vert.x codegen.
3. The `vertx-pinot-client` should offer better performance as it uses the Vert.x Web Client for the underlying transport.
   This allows the application to stay on the same event loop when interacting with Pinot.

## Usage

Add the `pinot-client` dependency to your project.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.reactiverse</groupId>
    <artifactId>pinot-client</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

You can create an instance of the client to interact with the Pinot cluster as follows.

```java
String brokerUrl = "localhost:8000";
VertxPinotClientTransport transport = new VertxPinotClientTransport(vertx);
VertxConnection connection = VertxConnectionFactory.fromHostList(vertx, List.of(brokerUrl), transport);
```

Now we can use the `Connection` to query the cluster. Here is an example to query the top 10 home run scorers from
the sample quickstart dataset.

```java
String query = "select playerName, sum(homeRuns) AS totalHomeRuns from baseballStats where homeRuns > 0 group by playerID, playerName ORDER BY totalHomeRuns DESC limit 10";
connection
    .execute(query)
    .onSuccess(resultSetGroup -> {
        ResultSet results = resultSetGroup.getResultSet(0);
        System.out.println("Player Name\tTotal Home Runs");
        for (int i = 0; i < results.getRowCount(); i++) {
            System.out.println(results.getString(i, 0) + "\t" + results.getString(i, 1));
        }
    })
    .onFailure(Throwable::printStackTrace);
```

## Demo

A more real-life demo is available at [`pizza-shop-demo`](https://github.com/lucifer4j/pizza-shop-demo). It includes a
pizza delivery service specializing in pizzas with Indian toppings. They have a dashboard built using Apache Pinot
to monitors their orders in realtime. The dashboard deals with three types of data: products, users, and orders. The
dashboard uses the Vert.x Pinot Client to [`query`](https://github.com/lucifer4j/pizza-shop-demo/blob/main/dashboard/backend/src/main/java/pizzashop/DashboardVerticle.java)
the Pinot cluster.

## Challenges

I worked on this project as a part of the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) - 2023 program and
during the implementation, I encountered several challenges.

#### Package-private `org.apache.pinot.client.BrokerResponse` class

The [`org.apache.pinot.client.BrokerResponse`](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/6e235a4ec2a16006337da04e118a435b5bb8f6d8/pinot-clients/pinot-java-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/client/BrokerResponse.java#L27)
class is package-private. However several [`executeQuery/executeQueryAsync`](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/6e235a4ec2a16006337da04e118a435b5bb8f6d8/pinot-clients/pinot-java-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/client/PinotClientTransport.java#L29)
methods in the `PinotClientTransport` return this type. This makes it difficult to implement the interface in an external package.

To work around this issue, we created a `org.apache.pinot.client` package inside our wrapper project. The [`VertxPinotClientTransport`](https://github.com/lucifer4j/pinot-client/blob/70dc4152cc77fd6ae521f94fb8c59bf4c7f9d12a/pinot-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/client/VertxPinotClientTransport.java#L37)
implementation currently lives inside this package for the same reason. This workaround only works for projects running in `classpath`
mode but not for projects using `modulepath` because Java Modules disallow package splitting. To fix the issue as source,
I opened a [`PR`](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10932) in `apache/pinot` repository. The PR is now merged. Once a new
release of Pinot is available, I will be updating the client wrapper as well.

#### `java.concurrent.util.Future` return type

Some methods of the `PinotClientTransport` [interface](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/6e235a4ec2a16006337da04e118a435b5bb8f6d8/pinot-clients/pinot-java-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/client/PinotClientTransport.java#L32)
return a `java.concurrent.util.Future` future. However, `Future.get` is a blocking call which is undesirable. To work around the
issue, we wrap every request and query call in an [`executeBlocking` block](https://github.com/reactiverse/pinot-client/blob/main/pinot-client/src/main/java/io/reactiverse/pinot/client/impl/Utils.java#L24-L34).
To avoid blocking calls altogether, we discussed replacing `Future` with `CompletabeFutre`. The same change has already been [merged](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10326)
now and will be available in the next release. Once that is available, we can update the wrapper client to adapt `CompletableFuture`s
to `Vert.x Futures` without much hassle and without having to offload some of the tasks to the Vert.x worker pool.

#### Missing `ConnectionFactory` method

The [`ConnectionFactory`](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/6e235a4ec2a16006337da04e118a435b5bb8f6d8/pinot-clients/pinot-java-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/client/ConnectionFactory.java#L30)
class is used to create `Connection` instances to interact with the Pinot Cluster. There are multiple ways to interact with
the cluster, using zookeeper, controller or a hard-coded broker list. Most of the methods feature an overload to accept
a custom `PinotClientTransport` implementation but the same was notable missing for the controller variant. Further, the
constructors of the `Connection` class are package-private preventing us from directly adding the missing method in our
wrapper.

Again to fix this issue, I created a [`bridge class`](https://github.com/lucifer4j/pinot-client/blob/70dc4152cc77fd6ae521f94fb8c59bf4c7f9d12a/pinot-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/client/ConnectionFactoryBridge.java#L28)
in the `org.apache.pinot.client` package. Simultaneously, I opened a [`PR`](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11013) in
`apache/pinot` repository. The PR is also now merged and the Vert.x client will be updated once a new release is available.

## Bonus Fixes

#### Missing double-checked locking in `ConnectionFactory`

While working on the tasks outlined earlier, I (more accurately my IDE's static checking) discovered the double-checked
locking mechanism in `ConnectionFactory` class in `pinot-client` was broken. I opened a [`PR`](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11014) to fix it.

#### Broken Docker health checks in `pizza-shop-demo`

The Docker Health Checks in the original `pizza-shop-demo` were broken. The health checks had been written using `nc` utility
but the same is not included in the `apache/pinot` docker image. It took me a lot of head scratching to discover that but
the same is now fixed. The PR for fixing it upstream is available [`here`](https://github.com/startreedata/pizza-shop-demo/pull/9).
