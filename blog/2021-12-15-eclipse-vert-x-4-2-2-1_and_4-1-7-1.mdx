  Eclipse Vert.x Webauthn version 4.2.2.1 and 4.1.7.1 has just been released.
---

Users of the module `vertx-auth-webauthn` should have noticed that since `Dec 15, 2021 09:00 UTC`, you cannot start any
webauthn application. The reason is that the root certificate for Android safety net attestation has **expired**.

The root certificate has been replaced with:

```text
 https://aboutssl.org/globalsign-root-certificates-licensing-and-use/
  Name 	gsr1
  Thumbprint: b1:bc:96:8b:d4:f4:9d:62:2a:a8:9a:81:f2:15:01:52:a4:1d:82:9c
  Valid Until 	28 January 2028
```

Users should only update this dependency until an upgrade to a regular next full stack release, for example, if you're
using maven as your build tool and on Vert.x 4.2.2, then:

```xml
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
      <artifactId>vertx-core</artifactId>
      <version>4.2.2</version>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
      <artifactId>vertx-auth-webauthn</artifactId>
      <!-- only this dependency version should be updated -->
      <version>4.2.2.1</version>
    </dependency>

  </dependencies>
```

The same applies for the previously maintained release 4.1.7:

```xml
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
      <artifactId>vertx-core</artifactId>
      <version>4.1.7</version>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
      <artifactId>vertx-auth-webauthn</artifactId>
      <!-- only this dependency version should be updated -->
      <version>4.1.7.1</version>
    </dependency>

  </dependencies>
```

No release was made for the 3.9 series because the `webauthn` module was just introduced with 4.x. Extra measures have
been taken to ensure that expired certificates will not block the start of applications in the future.

Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/channels).
