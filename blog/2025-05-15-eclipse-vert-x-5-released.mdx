We are extremely pleased to announce the release of Vert.x 5.

## What's new in Vert.x 5?

Vert.x 5 is the evolution of the Vert.x 4.x series that brings [key features](https://vertx.io/blog/whats-new-in-vert-x-5/) to Vert.x.

## From Vert.x 4 to Vert.x 5

Vert.x 5 extends the Vert.x 4 line with a set of new features while providing the same Vert.x 4 experience:
Vert.x 4 users will feel at home with Vert.x 5.

You can learn more about [migrating from Vert.x 4 to Vert.x 5](https://vertx.io/blog/from-vert-x-4-to-vert-x-5/).

## Without the community we are nothing

The [community](https://vertx.io/community/) of people made Vert.x 5 a reality.

Special thanks go to [Michel Krämer](https://michelkraemer.com/), the creator of this absolutely stunning website.

## Finally

The [5.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/5.0.0-Release-Notes) as well as
[deprecations and breaking changes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/5.0.0-Deprecations-and-breaking-changes)
 can be found on the wiki.

You can bootstrap a Vert.x 5 project using [start.vertx.io](https://start.vertx.io).

The release artifacts have been deployed to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.vertx%20AND%20v:5.0.0).

The [Vert.x 4 eventbus JavaScript client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vertx/eventbus-bridge-client.js) is now available
in a single location and it now usable standalone or it can easily be integrated with any frontend build tool.

That's it! Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/channels).
