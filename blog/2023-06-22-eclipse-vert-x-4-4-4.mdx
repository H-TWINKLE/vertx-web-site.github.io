We are extremely pleased to announce that Eclipse Vert.x version 4.4.4 has been released.

Since the release of Vert.x 4.4.4, quite a few bugs have been reported. We would like to thank you all for reporting these issues.

This release also upgrades to Netty 4.1.94.Final fixing [CVE-2023-34462](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-6mjq-h674-j845).

The [Vert.x gRPC plugin](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-grpc/java/#_vert_x_grpc_protoc_plugin) generating Vert.x idiomatic classes has also been ported to the new gRPC implementation.

```java
VertxGreeterGrpcServer.GreeterApi stub = new VertxGreeterGrpcServer.GreeterApi() {
 @Override
 public Future<HelloReply> sayHello(HelloRequest request) {
   return Future.succeededFuture(HelloReply.newBuilder().setMessage("Hello " + request.getName()).build());
 }
};
```

The [Vert.x 4 eventbus JavaScript client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vertx/eventbus-bridge-client.js) is now available
in a single location and it now usable standalone or it can easily be integrated with any frontend build tool.

The Vert.x distribution is available from [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io) and our
